# Usage
STAX is and always will be open source for the core framework itself. Credit will always be required on forks and code used outside of the framework itself.

STAX is a easy to use and syntactical framework where everything you use from the framework itself is autocompleted and documented.

# Purpose
STAX is being designed for developers to make projects with the easiest and most productive mindset and code in mind. I want this to make your creations easier than they ever were to create and make usable outside of the project itself using a `component` system.
